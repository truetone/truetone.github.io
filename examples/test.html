	<h2>Herman Melville</h2>
	<p>At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that.</p>

	<h2>L. Frank Baum</h2>
	<p>"I am everywhere," answered the Voice, "but to the eyes of common mortals I am invisible.  I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you may converse with me."  Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come straight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row while Dorothy said:</p>
	<p>"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz."</p>
	<p>"What promise?" asked Oz.</p>

	<h2>Edgar Rice Burroughs</h2>
	<p>The lesser hordes had commenced looting and quarreling among themselves, so it was decided that we collect what warriors we could, man as many vessels as possible with Zodangan prisoners and make for Helium without further loss of time.</p>
	<p>Five hours later we sailed from the roofs of the dock buildings with a fleet of two hundred and fifty battleships, carrying nearly one hundred thousand green warriors, followed by a fleet of transports with our thoats.</p>
	<p>Behind us we left the stricken city in the fierce and brutal clutches of some forty thousand green warriors of the lesser hordes.  They were looting, murdering, and fighting amongst themselves.  In a hundred places they had applied the torch, and columns of dense smoke were rising above the city as though to blot out from the eye of heaven the horrid sights beneath.</p>

	<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>
	<p>'Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said to Alice,  flinging the baby at her as she spoke. 'I must go and get ready to play  croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of the room. The cook threw  a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.</p>
	<p>Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped  little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, 'just  like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting  like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and  straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute  or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.</p>
	<p>As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to  twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right  ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried  it out into the open air. 'IF I don't take this child away with me,'  thought Alice, 'they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be  murder to leave it behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the  little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  'Don't grunt,' said Alice; 'that's not at all a proper way of expressing  yourself.'</p>

	<h2>Jack London</h2>
	<p>Here the old man launched into a disquisition on germs and their  natures, using words and phrases of such extraordinary length and  meaninglessness, that the boys grinned at one another and looked out  over the deserted ocean till they forgot the old man was babbling on.</p>
	<p>"But the Scarlet Death, Granser," Edwin at last suggested.</p>
	<p>Granser recollected himself, and with a start tore himself away from the  rostrum of the lecture-hall, where, to another world audience, he  had been expounding the latest theory, sixty years gone, of germs and  germ-diseases.</p>

	<h2>Jules Verne</h2>
	<p>Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the Custom House.  Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again.</p>
	<p>That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end.  This arrest was fatal.  Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.</p>
	<p>If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger, upon a wooden bench.  He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion.  Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment?  No one could tell.  There he sat, calmly waiting&mdash;for what?  Did he still cherish hope?  Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?</p>

	<h2>H.G. Wells</h2>
	<p>But no one heeded that very much.  At the sight of the Martian's collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the crowding passengers on the steamer's stern shouted together.  And then they yelled again.  For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts, its ventilators and funnels spouting fire.</p>
	<p>She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her engines working.  She headed straight for a second Martian, and was within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear.  Then with a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped upward.  The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of cardboard.  My brother shouted involuntarily.  A boiling tumult of steam hid everything again.</p>
	<p>"Two!" yelled the captain.</p>
