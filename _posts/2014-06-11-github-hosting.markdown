#Github Hosting

I'm not completely happy with this design, nor am I even close to being finised with the [weather project](/weather/), but I decided it was time to switch from Wordpress to Jekyll and take advantage of Github's free hosting.

I'll continue to change and improve this site over the coming months.

For now, not much to see here.
