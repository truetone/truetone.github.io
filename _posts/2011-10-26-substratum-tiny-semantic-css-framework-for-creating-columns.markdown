[I wrote about this a while back](http://anthonygthomas.com/2011/04/18/css-scaffolding/), but I thought I'd make it official since I've used it on the last few projects I've worked on. I've [named my mini CSS framework for creating columns and put it in a Mercurial repository](https://bitbucket.org/truetone/substratum). It's very small (412 kb minified), semantic and aims to stay out of the way. It also needs some thorough browser testing. Have at it folks.
