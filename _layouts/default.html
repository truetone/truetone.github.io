    <p>I am a Software Engineer for <a
    href="http://leadpages.net">Leadpages</a> where I work on the Application
    Services team supporting the main product and building API services</p>

    <p>It's all <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for me these days.</p>

    <p>I dabble in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for this site.</p>

    <p>I love good, well-formatted, DRY code and semantic HTML. (It's weird how
    much I love that stuff.)</p>

    <p>Accessibility is good for <em>everyone</em>. Make your stuff
    accessible.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m married with two daughters. My family is beautiful, smart and
    challenging.</p>
