    <p>I am a Web Developer for <a href="http://www.cehd.umn.edu">The College
    of Education and Human Developement</a> where I work with the Web Strategy
    team to support their mission of student recruitment and retention.</p>

    <p>It's all <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> for me these days.</p>

    <p>I dabble in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for this site, but
    my go to language for web applications is Python. I'm pretty good with
    JavaScript as well. I've worked with PHP for a very long time, but it's no
    longer my first choice for back end development.</p>

    <p>I love good, well-formatted, DRY code and semantic, accessible HTML.
    (It's weird how much I love that stuff.)</p>

    <p>Accessibility is good for <em>everyone</em>. Make your stuff
    accessible.</p>

    <p>I&quot;m married with two children. My family is beautiful, smart and
    challenging.</p>
